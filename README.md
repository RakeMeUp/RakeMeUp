# Hi, I am Bence!

I currently studying to be a front-end developer.

In my repositories, you may find multiple projects, made with different stacks.

Thourough my studies, I have used:
- React with Hooks
  - useState
  - useRef
  - useContext
  - useEffect
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Sass / Tailwind CSS
- a bit of Python, Php
